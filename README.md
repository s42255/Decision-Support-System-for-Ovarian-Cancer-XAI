## Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis System

This project is based on our research paper, *"An ML-based Decision Support System for Reliable Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer by Leveraging Explainable AI"*. The system uses machine learning models to predict ovarian cancer risk and provide explanations for the decisions.

We have also deployed the model on Hugging Face Spaces for interactive use. Check it out here:
